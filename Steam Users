For Steam Users-

The mod menu does work with the steam version of the game, not as well but it still does.

Because of Google TOS the file is within 2 zips, Menu.zip and v##.zip...

To install download the Menu.zip

Unzip the the folder open the folder and unzip v##.zip

If any you have any problems because of windows defender go to READ BEFORE USING.
